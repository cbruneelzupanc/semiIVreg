## Overview
<!-- <center>
![](images/causal_graph.png)
</center> -->


This package provides estimation procedure with semi-IVs, as in @bruneel2024.  
In particular, the main function `semiivreg()` estimates the marginal treatment effect (MTE) and marginal treatment response (MTR).

## semi-instrumental variable (semi-IV) regression
### The model

`semiivreg` estimates the marginal treatment effect (MTE) and marginal treatment response (MTR) of the following model.  

The potential outcomes are given by

\[
Y_0 = \delta_{0} + W_0 \beta_0 + X \beta^X_{0} + U_0, \quad \quad \quad (1)
\]

\[
Y_1 = \delta_{1} + W_1 \beta_1 + X \beta^X_{1} + U_1, \quad \quad \quad (2)
\]

with selection rule

\[
\begin{aligned}
D^* &= g(W_0, W_1, X) - V \\
&= - (\alpha + \alpha_0 W_0 + \alpha_1 W_1 + \alpha_{X} X ) - V, \quad \quad \quad (3) \\
\text{ with } \quad D &= \mathbb{I}(D^* > 0),
\end{aligned}
\]

where  

- **semi-IVs**: \(W_0\) (respectively \(W_1\)) are the semi-IVs excluded from \(Y_1\) (resp. \(Y_0\)). Each \(W_0\) and \(W_1\) may contain several variables. Nonparametric identification requires that each \(W_d\) contains *at least one excluded variable* (see @bruneel2024).  

- **Covariates**: \(X\) are the covariates that affect both potential outcomes. By default, wants different effect of the covariates across alternatives, (i.e., \(\beta^X_{0} \neq \beta^X_{1}\)). To do so, include the covariates separately in both MTR formulas: `semiivreg(y~d|w0+x|w1+x, data)`.
One can restrict the effect of \(X\) to be the same across both potential outcomes (i.e., \(\beta^X_{0} = \beta^X_{1}\)). To do so, specify:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
semiivreg(y~d|w0|w1|x, data)
```


- **Unobservables**: \(U_0\) and \(U_1\) are general unobservables (may include several shocks, some may be the same across alternatives) affecting the outcomes. \(V\) is a scalar unobservable that affects the selection. The lower \(V\), the more likely one is to select into treatment. Nonparametric identification requires *independence*, i.e., \((U_0, U_1, V) \perp (W_0, W_1) | X\).   
For estimation here, we additionally assume additive *separability* of the covariates \(X\), i.e., that \(E(U_d | V, X) = E(U_d | V)\) for both \(d=0,1\).   
This assumption is *not necessary* for the identification, nor for the estimation. But it is a standard *simplification* that helps the estimation. See @carneiroheckmanvytlacil2011, @brinch2017beyond or @andresen2018exploring for comparable examples of the estimation of MTE with IVs.




### Estimation procedure

The estimation procedure closely follows the counterpart estimation of MTE with standard IVs, see for e.g., Andresen (2018). The command estimates marginal treatment responses and marginal treatment effects, i.e.,

\[
\begin{aligned}
MTR_d(u, w_d, x) &= E(Y_d | X=x, W_d=w_d, U_D=u), \\
MTE(u, x, w_0, w_1) &= E(Y_1 - Y_0 | X = x, W_0=w_0, W_1=w_1, U_D=u) \\
&= MTR_1(u, w_1, x) - MTR_0(u, w_0, x),
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(U_D = F_V(V) \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 1)\) is the normalized unobserved resistance to treatment.

The estimation proceeds in two stages.    

#### 1. First stage: propensity score
Estimate the propensity score \(\widehat{P}\) of treatment selection of equation (3).  
By default, the function \(g(\cdot)\) is given by the simple linear specification above, but the code allows specifying any other first stage. For example:

```r
  semiivreg(y~d|w0+x|w1+x, data,
            propensity_formula = d~w0+w1+w0:w1+w0:x+w1:x+I(w0^2)+I(w1^2))
```

By default, the estimation assumes a *probit model* for the first stage (i.e., assumes \(V\) is normally distributed). However, you can specify other models (e.g., logit) using the `firststage_model` argument. In theory, any specification for the first stage could be added, and it is even possible to estimate the propensity score outside of the `semiivreg` command (this feature is not implemented yet).      





#### 2. Second stage: marginal treatment responses
Estimate the control function \(\kappa_d(P)\) of the potential outcomes \(Y_d\) given the propensity score \(P\) and the covariates \(X\). The control function is estimated with a flexible polynomial transformation of the propensity score. The estimation is done with a *stacked regression* of the potential outcomes specification (1)-(2):

\[
\begin{aligned}
E[Y|W_0, W_1, X, \widehat{P}] = &D \times ( \delta_{1} + W_1 \beta_1 + X \beta^X_{1} + \kappa_1(\widehat{P}) ) + \\
&(1-D) \times ( \delta_{0} + W_0 \beta_0 + X \beta^X_{0} + \kappa_0(\widehat{P})).
\end{aligned}
\]

where the control functions are sample estimates (using the estimate \(\widehat{P}\)) of their theoretical counterparts:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\kappa_1(P) &= E[ U_1 | D=1, W_1, W_0, X,P] = E[U_1|D=1, P] = E[U_1 | U_D \leq P] \\
\kappa_0(P) &= E[ U_0 | D=0, W_1, W_0, X,P] = E[U_0|D=0, P] = E[U_0 | U_D > P]
\end{aligned}
\]

By default, we estimate flexible polynomials of degree `pol_degree_transform` for \(\kappa_0(P)\) and \(\kappa_1(P)\).

About the semi-IVs and covariates, note that \(W_0\) and \(W_1\) can be flexible transformations (polynomial, splines) of specific variables, so the outcome equations are quite flexible (could also specify interactions between \(W_d\) and \(X\)).

Once the second stage equation is estimated, we don't need to estimate any other parameters, just to take the proper derivatives of the estimated functional form. We have:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{k}_1(u) &= E[ U_1 | U_D=u] = \widehat{\kappa}_1(u) + u \widehat{\kappa}_1'(u) \\
\widehat{k}_0(u) &= E[ U_0 | U_D=u] = \widehat{\kappa}_0(u) - (1-u) \widehat{\kappa}_0'(u)
\end{aligned}
\]

where the derivatives are easy to compute if \(\kappa\) is a polynomial function.

Then, the *Marginal Treatment Responses* are given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{MTR}_d(u, w_d, x) &= E(Y_d | X=x, W_d=w_d, U_D=u) = \widehat{\delta}_{d} + w_d \widehat{\beta}_d + x \widehat{\beta}^X_{d} + \widehat{k}_d(u)
\end{aligned}
\]

and the *Marginal Treatment Effects* are:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{MTE}(u, x, w_0, w_1) = \widehat{MTR}_1(u, w_1, x) - \widehat{MTR}_0(u, w_0, x)
\end{aligned}
\]







###  Special Case with Homogenous Treatment Effects

The *homogenous treatment effects* estimates correspond to the same potential outcome model (1)-(2), with \(U_0 = U_1 = U\).

This leads to known restrictions on the control functions \(\kappa_0(P)\) and \(\kappa_1(P)\) that we impose in the stacked second stage regression. Indeed,

\[
E(U) = 0 = E(U | U_D \leq P) P + E(U | U_D > P) (1-P)
\]

So, \(\kappa_0(P) = -\kappa_1(P) \frac{P}{1-P}\), and one can check that it yields \(k_0(u) = k_1(u) = k(u)\).

Thus, the MTE is constant (\(k_1(u) - k_0(u) = 0\), it cancels out), and equal to:

\[
\widehat{MTE}(x, w_0, w_1) = \widehat{\delta}_{1} - \widehat{\delta}_{0} + w_1 \widehat{\beta}_1 - w_0 \widehat{\beta}_0 + x (\widehat{\beta}^X_{1} - \widehat{\beta}^X_{0}).
\]

The MTR still varies with \(u\) because \(k(u)\) is not constant, and we also estimate it.

### Caution about the Estimated Standard Errors

By default, return *analytic standard errors* not accounting for the fact that the propensity score is estimated in `semiivreg`. Use `semiivreg_boot` to obtain 'correct' bootstrapped confidence intervals.





## Illustration with simulated Roy model

This illustrates what the `semiivreg()`command reports for a semi-IV regression. 
By default, it reports the common support plot of the propensity score and the estimated marginal treatment effects (MTE). 

```{r mte, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.align='center'} 
library(semiIVreg)
data(roydata) # load the data from a simulated Roy model

# semi-IV regression
semiiv = semiivreg(y~d|w0|w1, data=roydata) 
```

One can also easily extract a plot for the marginal treatment responses (MTR):
```{r mtr, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align='center'}
semiiv$plot$mtr
```
